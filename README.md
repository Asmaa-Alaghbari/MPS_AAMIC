# Generating Functions/Trees for Evaluating Optimal Binarizations

## Project Overview
This project introduces an innovative approach to image binarization, combining global and local thresholding techniques through decision trees. Our method aims to enhance the accuracy, recall, and F-measure of binarization processes, surpassing traditional methods. We employed a dynamic decision tree structure, informed by a dataset encompassing various binarization algorithms applied to a spectrum of images.
